# My Work

## Startups and Endeavors

I cofounded [VeriCare](https://vericareai.com), using AI to democratize medical billing for everyone. I also host [Neural Bridge Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/@NeuralBridgePodcast), "Bridging the Gap" for Gen Z students interested in AI. 

If you are interested, you can email me [here for VeriCare](mailto:vericareai@gmail.com)  and [here for Neural Bridge](mailto:neuralbridgepodcast@gmail.com).
